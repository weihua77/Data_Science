## Learning through Examples, not through Basics (yet)
You probably feel the same way as I do that we learn new things much faster through (good) examples, not definitions. I've seen myself countless times when learning new things, getting painfully stuck on basics for so long that when I finally finished I've already forgetten what I set out to accomplish. This is not a good experience of learning. I came to believe that with carefully chosen examples, we can bypass or at least delay the necessity and pain of learning the basics. Once we see the cool results we can achieve in the examples, we are more motivated to go back and consolidate the required basics. And if the results are not interesting to you, you simply move on without bothering to touch the basics. <br>

In the light of this philosophy, Data_Science_Daily repository is intended as a collection of effective Data Science techniques demonstrated with practical examples. I put them in the form of Jypyter notebooks since they are the perfect tool for us to play around the examples and make fun, small discoveries. The incremental nature of examples also makes easier my commitment to growing the content richer daily. 

## The Three Pillars of Data Science Skill Sets
----Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning

A data scientist is on a quest to extract information from data. He is mindful of each and every step he takes, from getting acquainted with the data all the way to delivering results based on it. In general there are 3 major steps involved: Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. The goal for Data Wrangling is to tranform the data into a form that is suitable for futher analysis and modeling. Data Analysis is the exploratory step to extract statistics and visualize relationships among variables, these operations provide insights as well as directions for the next step. Finally, Machine learning is mostly used for prediction purpose. This is certainly not the full story, but I want to keep this commenting short and hopefully I will be able to show it better using examples.

### What about Big Data and Deep Learning?
I do have some future plans to extend some of these skills to the realm of Big Data, but that extension should be a new perspective, not a replacement. As for Deep Learning, I may add it as part of Machine Learning, or as a separate topic in the future, but I haven't decided yet.

### Why Python?
I choose Python as the main programming language because of Python's comprehensive Data-oriented library ecosystem. It already contains the tools and libraries that will equip us to become an effective data scientist, and it's evergrowing. <br>


The field of Data Science is fasinating and is still evolving, I am still learning just as everyone else is. Use the materials here to suit your need, but take them with a grain of salt.
