## Learning through Examples, not (yet) through Basics
Interestingly, similar to machines, we learn new things much faster through (good) examples. I've seen myself countless times when learning new things, getting painfully stuck on basics for so long that once finished I've already forgetten what I set out to accomplish. With carefully chosen examples, we can bypass or at least delay the necessity and pain of learning the basics. Once we see what cool results we can achieve, we are more motivated to go back and consolidate the required basics. Or if the results are not something that you're seeking, you move on without bothering to touch the basics. <br>

In the light of this philosophy, Data_Science_Daily repository is intended as a collection of useful and effective Data Science techniques demonstrated with clear and practical examples in the form of Jypyter notebooks. Notebooks are the perfect tool for us to play around the examples and make fun, small discoveries. 

The incremental nature of examples also makes easier my commitment to growing the content richer daily. 

## The Three Pillars of Data Science Skills
I decided to focus on three major pillars of Data Science skills (mostly for Structured/Tabular data): Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I do have some future plans to extend some of these skills to the realm of Big Data, but that extension should be a new perspective, not a replacement.

I choose Python as the main programming language because of its well-established tool sets and an evergrowing ecosystem. <br>

The field of Data Science is fasinating and is still evolving, I am still learning just as everyone else is. Take everything here with a grain of salt.
