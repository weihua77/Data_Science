# Data Science Daily
---- Learning Through Examples, not Basics

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/weihua77/Data_Science_Daily/master)

We learn much faster through (good) examples, not definitions. And it is not a good experience of learning when struggling with basics without knowing whether the outcome is going to be useful. I came to believe that we can ease the pain of learning the basics with carefully chosen examples. Once we see clearly the effectiveness and relevance of the results in the examples, we are happier and more motivated to dive in and acquire the basics. And if the end results are not interesting, we can simply move on without bothering to touch the basics. <br>

In the light of this philosophy, the repository is intended as a resource of learning effective Data Science techniques through a collection of practical examples. I put them in the form of Jypyter notebooks since they are the perfect tool for us to play around the examples and make fun, small discoveries. And the binder flag above enables a download-free way to play with these notebooks. The incremental nature of examples also makes easier my commitment to growing the content richer daily.

### Why Choose These Topics?
The Three Pillars of Data Science Skills: Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning

A data scientist is on a quest to extract information from data. He is mindful of each and every step he takes, from getting acquainted with the data all the way to delivering results based on it. In general there are 3 major steps involved: Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. The goal for Data Wrangling is to tranform the data into a form that is suitable for futher analysis and modeling. Data Analysis is the exploratory step to extract statistics and visualize relationships among variables, these operations provide insights as well as directions for the next step. Finally, Machine learning is powerful tool for making predictions. I will strive to clearly demonstrate these through both toy and practical examples.

### Why Python?
I choose Python as the main programming language because of Python's comprehensive data-oriented library ecosystem. It already has all the tools and libraries that will equip us to be effective data scientists, and it's evergrowing. <br>

### What about Big Data and Deep Learning?
I do have some future plans to extend some of these skills to the realm of Big Data, but that extension should be a new perspective, not a replacement. As for Deep Learning, I may add it as part of Machine Learning, or as a separate topic in the future.

The field of Data Science is fasinating and is still evolving, I am still learning just as everyone else is. Use the materials here to suit your need, but take them with a grain of salt.
