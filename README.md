# Data Science Daily
Data_Science_Daily repository is constructed as a systematic collection of crucial Data Science techniques demonstrated with clear and practical examples in the form of Jypyter notebooks. The content grows richer daily. <br>

I focus on three major pillars of Data Science skills (mostly for structured data): Data Wrangling, Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I do have some future plans to extend some of these skills to the realm of Big Data and/or adding a section of Deep Learning, but mainly as a comparison to these core skills while standing alone and clear without the influences of the two. As for now, these three pillars shall suffice on its own for common structured data. I choose Python as the main programming language because of its well-established tool sets and an evergrowing ecosystem. <br>

The field of Data Science is fasinating and is still evolving, I am still learning just as everyone else is. Take everything here with a grain of salt.
