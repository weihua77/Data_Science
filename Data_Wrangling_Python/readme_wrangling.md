The goal of Data Wrangling is to transform the data into a form that is more *suitable* for further **analysis and modeling**. This goal should be made clear in all the wrangling operations in the notebooks here in this folder.

The notebooks in this folder are mainly excerpts from Wes McKinney's "Python for Data Analysis" 2nd Edition, made more clear 
and enriched with new/additional examples and notes. Whenever needed, please refer back to the book for more details .

As the file names suggest, we need to perform a series of operations to whip the data into shape for further analysis. These operations are mostly covered in chapter 6-13 in McKinney's book. I chose these contents because in my opinion they are the most crucial and relevant techniques. If you find some of them interesting and useful for you, you can pursuit further to understand the basics under the hood.

In case you are looking for it, I moved the content of Data Visualization into the folder of Data Analysis, since it makes more sense there. I do want to mention that the method chaining in data wrangling can work seamlessly with data visualization, creating a smooth data exploration experience.

The contents covered here is by no means comprehensive, but relatively complete on its own. I am confident that mastering these contents will make you feel comfortable with daily Data-Wrangling tasks.
